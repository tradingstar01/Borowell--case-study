## *Borrowell products and services*

1. **Borrowell Free Credit Score**

By signing up for a Borrowell account, Canadians can check their Equifax credit report and credit score at no cost. Your credit score is a three-digit number that helps lenders assess your creditworthiness. Having a low credit score can make it difficult to get approved for loans, credit cards or even a rental property. Having a higher credit score makes it easier to get approved, and may mean paying lower interest rates.

2. **Borrowell Rent Advantage**

In July 2022, Borrowell introduced a new product called Rent Advantage. Available only to select Borrowell members, this program is designed to help get on-time rent payments reported to Equifax Canada. Rent Advantage is touted as a debt-free way for renters to build their credit score and history. 

3. **Borrowell Credit Builder**

Available only to certain Borrowell members, this product is designed to help Canadians build a strong credit profile by making payments on a $240-$1,440 secured installment loan over the course of 36 months. All payments, including any you might miss, are reported to Equifax.

4. **Borrowell Bill Tracking**

Borrowell members who choose to use its mobile app have access to a bill tracking feature that is connected to their bank account. The bill tracking feature analyzes transaction histories to help users pay their recurring bills on time and know if their balance is running low.
